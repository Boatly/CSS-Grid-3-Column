### What does a Scrum Master do?
Scrum Masters serve members of their Scrum teams by gathering data for inspection and improvement. They seek to improve processes and remove impediments. 

In short, they're leaders, facilitators, and amplifiers.

### What do technical writers and Scrum Masters have in common? 
Quite a lot, which makes transitioning from a tech writing role to a Scrum Master role feel natural.

 For example, both roles require empathy for their audiences. While technical writers often focus on product users, Scrum Masters focus on team members. 

In addition, they both bring structure to chaos. For technical writers, this means gathering information and creating useful documentation with that information. Scrum Masters use Agile and Scrum processes to gather data, which they then communicate to team members.
