# Web-Portfolio
This is a simple personal web portfolio. If you notice any issues, from gramamr to browser display issues, submit a pull request and I'll see what I can do about it.

I needed to update my online presence and I wanted to mess around with CSS Grid. This site is the result.

## How it's built
From a technical standpoint, it's pretty basic: HTML, CSS, and some vanilla JavaScript. CSS Grid is the site's backbone.

Hosted by Netlify at http://www.rollinsky.com/ and deployed from the "prod" branch. As part of continuous delivery, any changes to "prod" will be reflected in the live site.
