Hey everyone, I recently re-built my online portfolio (built from scratch and hosted with Netlify). I'd appreciate some feedback if anyone is so inclined.

I hope this doesn't come across as self-promotional. I really am look for constructive criticism here. Anything from career relevance to my ugly JavaScript.

I found myself pushing release back and back because there's always something that could be done just a liiiiittle bit better. Forced myself to just get it out there. The mobile experience particularly isn't ready yet. I'm working on it. :slightly_smiling_face:

Thanks for your time! (edited)

The only thing that sticks out to me is "Intellection" in the Clifton Strengths?
Well, now that I look further, not the only thing: there's no dates listed for your work history. (edited)

@krollins First reaction was "too much text, not reading that". I'd suggest:
- Smaller font
- Adding more margin/whitespace on sides
- Moving your work samples up so I don't have to scroll to see them
- Moving your bio somewhere else (although might be less of a problem with smaller font)

krollins [8 days ago]
Nice. These are great observations. Thank you!

Intellection is one of the categories in the CliftonStrengths assessment. Also, it's definitely a word. :wink: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellection

TIL.

"To get in touch, follow the social media links in the header." I don't see any links. Is it my ad blocker?

wouter [8 days ago]
Another thing: I don't need the interactivity on your work history (with the expandable boxes). It's not that discoverable and I'd rather be able to read that content straight off the bat (no clicking). (edited)

james.rhea [8 days ago]
I don't know... I like the clean/uncluttered look w/o the details shown. But I do agree that clicking on each one is probably more than most folks would do.

krollins [8 days ago]
It was definitely an attempt to de-clutter. All of that text at once can be a bit much, IMO. My thought was most people aren't going to be interested in all of them anyway and would explore the two or maybe three they found interesting. But that's based on zero research and is 100% speculation.

I'll have to think about that one: balancing designeyness and readability vs immediacy of info.

krollins [8 days ago]
@james.rhea I assume it's your add-blocker - though that would be weird. They're just font-awesome icons with <a> tags around them to Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles.

james.rhea [8 days ago]
Yep. That was it.

Maybe it's me, but the Chi User Guide is looking wonky on my end. Some of the arrows you added are not lining up with the screenshots, for example. And the table of figures is not lining up correctly. (edited)

krollins [8 days ago]
Thanks, @pzwicker! I should have mentioned that some of those samples are very old (from my college days).

I need to clean them up and it's on my to-do list. I should add it as an issue in GitHub. Thanks for mentioning it!

Nice job on the site! I agree with @wouter regarding your work experience. I also think it might be redundant since your resume is attached. My opinion is that a personal site should be something that supplements your resume (which yours definitely does since it showcases your writing, design, and js skills)! I don’t think the work experience section is needed. I’m no hiring manager though, so take my opinion with a grain of salt!

This might be a bit nitpicky, but I read the URL as the Polish-sounding Rollinski, and then Roll In Sky, since I couldn't really figure it out. After a few minutes though, I figured you were going for Rollins, K.Y. May want to think about using something like kylerollins if it's available. (edited)

krollins [8 days ago]
Thanks, @questy. I'll re-evaluate whether the work history section is needed. I put it in there because it just seemed to make sense, but, it may not even be necessary.

@Christina Mayr, ha, yeah. You're absolutely right; it's not the most readable URL. I'll have to see what's available. I don't recall why I landed on this one - I've had it for years. In my head, I say "Rollinski" too.

crispybacon [8 days ago]
@krollins out of curiosity, why not go with krollins.com? Was that taken?

krollins [8 days ago]
I honestly cannot remember. I should check. Don't you buy it, @crispybacon! :wink:

crispybacon [8 days ago]
My master plan has been revealed!

crispybacon [8 days ago]
looks like krollins.com is taken. :disappointed:
my master plan is foiled. (edited)

Maybe he beat you to it...

Sounds like the topic @eringrace will cover during the conference :grinning:

krollins [7 days ago]
Unfortunately, no, I didn't get krollins.com. I opted for kyleblankrollins.com. I don't have a middle name, so I've often used "kyleblankrollins" as a jokey way to get a unique, yet still somewhat professional, username or what-have-you.



james.rhea [8:57 AM]
From your site intro: "meet great people and learned invaluable skills" -- Should "meet" be "met"?

krollins [8:58 AM]
Absolutely. Nice catch, and thank you!

I've spent a bit too much time looking at this site. ha

james.rhea [8:59 AM]
You're welcome. And I like it. Nicely done!
I thought it was curious, though, that the PDF Experience section doesn't align with the Work history section on the site.
Overall, though, it's clean, modern, and interactive without being cluttered. Cool.

krollins [9:06 AM]
Are you referring to the resume PDF in the Contact section?

You're right; it does make more sense in the Work History section. I'll see what I can do about moving that around.

james.rhea [9:08 AM]
What I mean is that the contents of the PDF doesn't match the contents of the Work history section.
You have 6 items in each, but they're not all the same 6.

krollins [9:08 AM]
Oooh, I see.
That's a good point. I hadn't even considered, as I ported the resume content from an older resume. I'll update one or the other so they match.

james.rhea [9:11 AM]
:+1:

Thanks! I'll take a peek at your site later today. :slightly_smiling_face:

For whatever reason, I have this idea in my head that people need to be introduced to the site gradually - hence the About section at the top. But I definitely hear what you're saying. I need to re-evaluate and I'll probably move things around.

It's certainly better than the essay I had there when first putting the site together. ha!

wouter [9:12 AM]
Well, I would definitely agree that gradual is good, but frontloading text is actually the opposite of that, for me. :slightly_smiling_face: First, I need to be convinced that it's worth reading. In this day and age, there's a near-overwhelming amount of information on your computer screen at any given time, and you can't possibly read all of it.

krollins [9:15 AM]
Great point! I'll reduce the text further. Thanks again for taking the time to look it over.

wouter [9:28 AM]
my pleasure, props for sharing :thumbsup_all:
