The postbar's recent posts should be limited to the latest three. First, the GraphQL query is sorted by ascending date, then it's limited to three entries. Keeps the post-bar relevant, yet compact.

The sidebar should behave similarly, but is limited to 10 posts, as it has more real estate to work with.
