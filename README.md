# kyleblankrollins.com source code
This repository contains the source code for [kyleblankrollins.com](https://www.kyleblankrollins.com/)(KBR) and its subdomains.

## Building KBR
KBR is a static site. In fact, it's almost entirely just HTML and CSS.

## Netlify and subdomains
Netlify serves the `prod` branch for KBR. The `netlify.toml` file tells Netlify how to handle serving other branches as subdomains of KBR.

## Current subdomains
+ [The Canney Valley](https://the-canney-valley.kyleblankrollins.com/).
+ [DoK Compare](https://dok-compare.kyleblankrollins.com/#/).
